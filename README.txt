Sprint Review:
    What did we learn from doing our first sprint?

    What did go well? Why?

    What didnâ€™t go well? Why not?

    How can you make things better next time?

    Are you satisfied with what you already completed?

    Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
